We seek to solve two problems that the company is facing:

- find out the differences in customers across product lines. eg. do newer products attract younger or more affluent people?

- do people with darker skin tones experience more malfunctions in their devices in terms of sleep-tracking?


Results:

- Created a poisson regression model to address sleep tracking issues with customers with darker skin tones. Found that people with darker skin tones record around 11.8 flags per hour, while those with lighter skin tones had an average of 1.2 flags per hour.

- Using ggplot2 and separately a tableau dashboard, prepared clear and appropriate data visualizations, executive summary, and technical report which addressed and resolved the clientâ€™s challenges.
